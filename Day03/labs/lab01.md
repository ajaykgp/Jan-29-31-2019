### Create a list of numbers from 1 to 1000

* Parallely, try to implement the following

* Print **any** even number that is greater than 500 (Run it few times and check the output)
* Print the **sum** of even numbers greater than 100 (Run it few times and check the output)


* Print the **first** even number greater than 500 (Run it few times and check the output)


### Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100000

* Print the sum of squares all numbers (find out the time taken in milliseconds)

* Use parallel and Print the sum of squares all numbers (find out the time taken in milliseconds)

* Use **ForJoinPool** and **increase** the number of threads and print the sum of squares all numbers (find out the time taken in milliseconds)

* Compare and study the output
